        <br>
        <p class="subheading">Makima (マキマ Makima?) is a high-ranking Public Safety Devil Hunter, who took Denji as her human pet. She is later revealed to be the Control Devil (支し配はいの悪あく魔ま Shihai no Akuma?) which embodies the fear of control or conquest. She serves as the overall main antagonist of the Public Safety Saga.</p>

          <h2 class="heading">Appearance</h2>
          <p class="subheading">
            Makima is a beautiful woman who appears to be in her mid-twenties. Her hair colour is a light red, normally kept in a loose braid with bangs reaching just past her eyebrows and two longer side bangs that frame her face. Her eyes are yellow with multiple red rings within them.

        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <h2 class="heading">Personality</h2>
          <p class="subheading">Makima is extremely cunning and manipulative. She controls Denji through the promise of a romantic and sexual relationship while also threatening him with extermination if he disobeys her. Ruthless and normally emotionless, she will do whatever it takes to reach her goals, even at the cost of the people she should be protecting.
          <br><br>
          Makima is an extreme fan of Chainsaw Man, the "Hero of Hell". Fascinated by its ability to wipe out the embodied concept of a devil through consuming them, her stated goal is to bring Chainsaw Man under her control in order to use its abilities to create an ideal world without fear, death, and “bad” movies. However, failure is also acceptable, as it would mean being eaten—an honor according to her.
          <br><br>
          Makima's true goal, however, was to be together forever with Pochita and lead a happy life with him. She always yearned for something like a family, being incapable of forming equal and meaningful relationships as the control devil.          </p>

          <p class="subheading"><b>Immense Strength: </b>Makima possesses a great deal of physical strength allowing her to fight effectively in hand-to-hand combat without relying on any of her subordinates. Her strength was great enough to overwhelm Pochita and shatter his chainsaws with her strikes.
            <br><br>
            <b>Enhanced Smell:</b> According to Denji, Makima primarily differentiates others through smell. In their first encounter, she was able to detect that Pochita still existed within Denji through his scent.

          <p class="subheading"><b>Control Devil Abilities: </b>The full extent of Makima's abilities are mostly unknown. She has shown a variety of abilities either inherent as a devil, or borrowed from another devil. The following is a list of her shown abilities:
            <br><br>
            <b>Contract Creation:</b> As a devil, the Control Devil can bestow contracts upon humans for a price. Thanks to her ability to control humans, she can force them to make a contract with herself. The Control Devil has a contract with the Prime Minister of Japan in exchange of working for Japan.
            <br><br>
            <b>Blood Consumption: </b>As a devil, the Control Devil should be able to restore its health by consuming blood.[10] She has been shown to regenerate her arm that has been damaged by Darkness Devil, however, it is unknown whether this ability is derived from her regeneration ability or her contract with the Prime Minister.
            <br><br>
            <b>Revival: </b>As a devil, the Control Devil will revive in Hell after being killed effectively making it immortal.[11] After she has been eaten by Denji, she returned to Hell and subsequently reincarnated in China as Nayuta.
